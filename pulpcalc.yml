# A set is the main data structure for a simulation, it provides context for running the simulation,
# and the method for running the simulation itself (the latter not needed in config).
#
# Simulations can be run concurrently, which means you can provide multiple sets in this config file
# that are to be simulated. Set definitions can be found in the `simulator/sets` folder, README, or
# below :) Currently the config for all sets is the same at which point the differentiating factor for
# the simulation logic is determined by `simulation_type`.
